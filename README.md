Shout out to my project partner s.x.

We worked on a python based object-oriented program for a computer science course. 
The  project  involved  applying  state-space  search  to  a  classic  problem  known  as  the  Eight Puzzle.
The overall goal was to write a program that could  solve  any  valid  initial  conguration  of  the Eight  Puzzle.
We concluded the project by creating our own efficient heuristic algorithm.

There are 5 python files in this repository:
Each file contains the script for 1+ classes needed to solve an Eight Puzzle.

1. board.py
2. eight_puzzle.py
3. searcher.py
4. state.py
5. timer.py

For functionality on your machine, each file must be saved separately as a .py file within the same directory and properly called on the IDLE shell. 

Note, you must have sufficient practice in python object oriented programming to get a proper output after each method call.
